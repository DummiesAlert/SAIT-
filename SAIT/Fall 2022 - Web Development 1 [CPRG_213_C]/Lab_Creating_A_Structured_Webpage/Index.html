<p style="float:right"><big>This octopus burger has been Seattles burger for almost a 
    decade and has been a very popular food to enjoy. The main 
    reason people loved this burger, is it's special guest the
    octopus and the tenticles are chewy and tender. As Fleming 
    said “It’s one of the things my wife and I talk about where, 
    whenever we go out to eat, we order it every time,” because 
    it's so delicious - 2012, Additionally, Fleming stated that
    "because of COVID-19, sourcing local octopus has been difficult, 
    so they’ve been sourcing a sustainable, trap-caught octopus 
    from Spain." Overall, this burger is an excellent choice as 
    being part of your breakfast, lunch and/or dinner. </big></p>
